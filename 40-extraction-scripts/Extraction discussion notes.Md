# Discussion Notes for extraction

-----------------------------------------------

### Adeyiko, 2014

- 2: includes 'regularly'; could be M or A. Changed into consistent with AM.

-----------------------------------------------

### Adusi-Poku, 2012

- 1: Self
- 2: Split into separate beliefs
- 1-3: negative, A (consistent, MD contrast.

-----------------------------------------------

### Astley, 2000

- 1-8: self, target behavior = AM (inconsistent), contrast with D
- 5: neutral
- 7-8: negative

-----------------------------------------------

### Balachova, 2014

- Motivation to comply (part of SN but not SN)
- Target (self vs other): unspecified

-----------------------------------------------

### Balachova, 2016

- 1: risk perception, unspecified, positive, target behavior is M, consistent, contrast AD
- 2: risk perception, self/other, positive, target MD, consistent, contrast A
- 3: severity, self/other, multiple, target MD, inconsistent, contrast A
- 4-7: attitude, some self, some other, 4,5 positive, 6, 7 negative, target behavior DM, 4,5 consistent, 6,7 inconsistent, contrast behavior A
- 8: risk perception, self/other, neutral statement (not pos or neg), target behavior is DM, consistent, contrast A
- 9: four questions; each risk perception, self/other, first three positive and last negative; target behavior is DM, consistent except fourth one; contrast behavior always A
- 10: code separately; all risk perception; all other except first one which is other/self; negative; target behavior is DM; inconsistent with target behavior; contrast behavior is A
- 11: knowledge; no target (i.e. self/other); neutral; 
- 12-14: removed; not reported sufficiently specificly

-----------------------------------------------

### Blume, 2007

- 1: risk perception, other, negative, target behavior MD, inconsistent with target behavior, contrast behavior is A
- 2: attitude, self, positive, target behavior MD, consistent with target behavior, constrast behavior is A
- 3-5: first email authors; they only reported multivariate data, which was analysed the wrong way (ordinal variables added as if they were cardinal).

-----------------------------------------------

### Brittain, 2017

- 1: Ask authos to show operationalisation before making final decision

-----------------------------------------------

### Chang, 2017

- 1: barriers & temptation; target behavior is abstinence; inconsistent with target behavior; constrast MD
- 2: coping self-efficacy; target behavior is abstinence; inconsistent with target behavior; constrast MD

#### Notes during processing of extraction scripts

We decided to exclude this article. The efficacy measures are useful, but the dependent measure ('stage of change' operationalised by contrasting participants in the 'precontemplation stage' with participants in the 'action stage') is not useful. This was based on the answers to four items measuring 'precontemplation' and four items measuring 'action' from the 12-item 'readyness to change questionnaire'; participants were designated to whichever category they scored highest in. That means that not only does this measure conflate motivational/volitional aspects of psychology with behavior, it's also true that for any given participant, the scores on both dimensions might be practically equivalent.

-----------------------------------------------

### Croxford, 1999

- 1: The question is not clear; Table 3 is not included in the manuscript; it is not clear to what degree this concerns alcohol specifically. We exclude this study.

-----------------------------------------------

### Donelly, 1998

- 1: This study is also excluded; this operationalisation does not measure anything useful, given the extreme answer categories.

-----------------------------------------------

### Dupraz, 2013

- 1: Correct as in Excel sheet
- 2: Correct as in Excel sheet
- 3-6: together form one ordinal variable; following the order in the article, these items express the norm towards drinking. So target behavior is drinking; it's a bidimensional scale, so it is not positive or negative per se; it concerns the self; it's consistent with the target behavior; and the contrast behavior is abstinence.

-----------------------------------------------

### Eaton, 2014

- 1:3: Correct as in Excel sheet
- 4: other, neutral, target moderate, consistent, contrast abstinence
- 5: other, neutral, target moderate, consistent, contrast abstinence

-----------------------------------------------

### Howlett, 2017

- Correct as in Excel sheet

-----------------------------------------------

### Johnson, 2017

- Studies alcohol use as a consequence of depression, not changes in alcohol use during pregnancy

-----------------------------------------------

### Kaminski, 1995

- 1-2: Not consistent but inconsistent! So: risk perception, other, negative, MD (inconsistent), contrast behavior abstinence
- 3: Ordinal variable; risk perception, but reverse coded; target behavior is drinking, consistent with drinking (until the coding is reversed), constrasting with abstinence.
contrast with AM, not only M

#### Notes during processing of extraction scripts

We exclude the third variable, in Table 7. Although perhaps with a lot of work some indicator of risk perception could be derived from this table, it would be a very low-quality measure of risk perception. Given that we already learned that risk perception may be a relevant determinant in some cases, the conclusions of the review will not change depending on whether we include or exclude this measure.

-----------------------------------------------

### Kaskutas, 2000

- Only first extracted; only first percentage, 17%, overall. This is response efficacy, positive, target behavior is abstinence and moderation, consistent with abstinence, contrast drinking.

-----------------------------------------------

### Kesmodel, 2002

- 1: See table 2: Should a pregnant woman pay attention to her alcohol intake? Ordinal variable; six levels; personal norm, not positive or negative, but neutral; target behavior is abstinence and moderation, inconsistent with target behavior, contrast behavior is drinking
- 2: Correct as in Excel sheet

-----------------------------------------------

### Kristjanson, 2007

- 1-4: inconsistent with drinking, not consistent. Contrast behavior is abstinence and moderation. Also, 1 is miscarriage; that's self, not other.
- 5: knowledge, self/other, neutral, no target behavior, no contrast behavior
- 6-8: M should be removed as contrast behavior, for the rest the excel sheet is correct.

-----------------------------------------------

### Lee, 2010

- 1: self (no baby yet)
- 1-4: Target behavior: drinking. Negative. Inconsistent. Contrast behavior abstinence.
- 5: knowledge; neutral.

-----------------------------------------------

### Lelong, 1995

- 1: Risk perception, other, negative, target behavior = drinking, inconsistent with target behavior, contrast behavior = abstinence
- 2: Risk perception, self, negative, target behavior = drinking, inconsistent with target behavior, contrast behavior = abstinence

-----------------------------------------------

### Leonardson, 2007

-----------------------------------------------

- 1: Correct as in Excel sheet

-----------------------------------------------

### McKnight, 1987

- 1 was deleted; this is the lead-in for 2-4
- 2-4: All the same; all correct.
- 5-7 - These cannot be extracted; correspondence between intention and behavior is not useful, because this can also mean that people perform *better*. In addition, intention is not a useful determinant. Therefore, this is useful to discuss, but cannot be extracted and integrated with the other evidence.

-----------------------------------------------

### Moore, 1996

- 1: beliefs: attitude, positive, target behavior is drinking, consistent with target behavior, contrast behavior is abstaining
- 2: norms: injunctive norms, positive, target behavior is drinking, consistent with target behavior, contrast behavior is abstaining
- 3: self-efficacy: self-efficacy, positive, target behavior is abstinence; consistent with target behavior; constrast behavior is drinking

-----------------------------------------------

### Onwuka, 2016

- All correct as in Excel sheet

-----------------------------------------------

### Peadon, 2011

- 1-4: expectation: no target individual (self or other), target behavior is drinking, bidimensional scale so not consistent or inconsistent, contrast behavior is abstinence or moderation
- 5: Correct as in excel sheet
- 6: Correct as in excel sheet
- 7: personal norm, not attitude
- 8-9: Not clear when participants' attitude was considered 'negative' or 'positive'

-----------------------------------------------

### Pettigrew, 2016

- 1: personal norm,
- 2: expectation,
- 3: intention, none has a target object (e.g. self or other); target behavior is moderate for first two, drinking for last one; all consistent with their target behaviors; contrast behaviors are drinking for the first two and moderating or abstaining for the last one.

-----------------------------------------------

### Richman, 1995

- Exclude; only associations with drinking 6 months after pregnancy; and unclear whether both parents completed the measures, or if not, which one.

-----------------------------------------------

### Strychar, 1990

- 1: risk perception, self/other, negative, target behavior is drinking, inconsistent with target behavior (drinking), contrast behavior is AM
- 2: risk perception, other, negative, target behavior is abstinence, consistent with target behavior, contrast behavior is DM
- 3: risk perception, other, positive, target behavior is abstinence, consistent with target behavior, contrast behavior is DM
- 4: self-efficacy, no object (e.g. self or other), positive, target behavior is moderate, consistent with target behavior, contrast behavior is drinking

-----------------------------------------------

### Testa, 1996

- Only multivariate analyses; we'd need the correlation matrix to extract data.

-----------------------------------------------

### Van der Wulp

- 1: negative
- 6: social self-efficacy; inconsistent with abstinence (level of difficulty)
- 7: stress self-efficacy; inconsistent with abstinence (level of difficulty)
- For all of them the contrast behavior is MD

-----------------------------------------------

### Yamamoto

- Correct as in Excel sheet
