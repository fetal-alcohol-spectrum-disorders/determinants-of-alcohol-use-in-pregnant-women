### Work through the sections below, and complete the information. There
### are three types of information:
###   - Text:   this can be any content; has to be in between double quotes.
###   - Number: Any number; cannot contain any other  characters, should not be quoted.
###   - NA:     For missing information, just use NA, always without quotes (just
###             the two characters NA).
###   – Vector: Lists of either numbers of text elements; see the instructions!

### SAMPLING AND SAMPLE DESCRIPTION
##########################################################################

### Description of sampling method
res$sample$samplingDesign <- NA;	 ### 'longitudinal' vs 'cross-sectional'
res$sample$samplingAselect <- FALSE; ### can also be TRUE
res$sample$samplingPregnant <- TRUE; ### TRUE if the sample includes pregnant women, can also be FALSE
res$sample$samplingPregnantAlcohol <- NA;	 ### TRUE if the sample includes pregnant women who also drink alcohol, can also be FALSE
res$sample$recruitmentSetting <- NA; ### For example "antenatal clinic",or NA

### Sample Method
res$sample$native <- NA; ### TRUE for native/aboriginal populations (e.g. inuit, aboriginals, etc)

### Description of sample, in text
res$sample$description <- "Description of sample"

### Description of geography of sample, in text
res$sample$geography <- "United Kingdom"

### Study year, in text
res$sample$year <- NA;

### Sample size, as a number
res$sample$size <- 20;

### SUBSAMPLES - REMOVE THIS SECTION IF THERE ARE NO SUBSAMPLES

### Indicate which information you want to override. Specify the subsample
### you're providing new data for in the single quotes between the double
### brackets; make sure the spelling is exactly identical to the list above.
### Use NA to specify data that should not be overridden.

res$subsample[[length(res$subsample) + 1]] <- list( ### Create object for this subsample
  name = NA,
  description = NA,
  size = NA                              ### Additional variables specified as univariate data for this subsample
)

##########################################################################
### METHODOLOGICAL INFORMATION
##########################################################################

### Specify how the data was collected ("qualitative" or "quantitative", or "both")
res$datacollectionmethod <- "qualitative";

### Specify how many measurement moments the study has, as a number (of
### course, this will just be 1 for most studies)
res$measurementMoments <- 1

### For each measurement moment, specify the number of days since the
### first measurement moment. This is a vector of days; e.g., for three
### measurement moments, each a month apart, this would be:
### res$measurementTimes <- c(0, 30, 60);
res$measurementTimes <- c(0)
